# Email Configuration

Rocket.Chat features include using emails, notifications, email verification, mailer, and much more.

Before using those features, you must connect a SMTP server to Rocket.Chat. To do that, you must have access to a SMTP server and a valid SMTP log in credentials.

## Set up your Credentials

Go to `Administration settings > Email > SMTP`.

Enter:

* Your SMTP server host name \(e.g. `mail.example.com`\)
* The port \(usually 587 for modern secured SMTP servers\)
* Your credentials
* A name and email to appear in the `From` field of the emails

Once completed, click **Save changes**.

## Test Changes

Go back into the `SMTP settings` and click **Test SMTP settings**. You should receive an email within a few minutes. If you do not, check the logs \(`Administration > View Logs`\) to see what happened.

**Note**: Make sure `Debug logging` is on; the default is to log information only.
