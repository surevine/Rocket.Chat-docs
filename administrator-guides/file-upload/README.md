# File Upload

There are several choices for file storage:

* GridFS
* [Amazon S3](amazon-s3.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage](google-cloud-storage.md)
* [WebDAV](webdav.md)
* [Minio](minio.md) - Self-hosted S3 compatible object storage
* Local File System

To change the system from the default GridFS, select the option you prefer from the `Storage Type` section.
