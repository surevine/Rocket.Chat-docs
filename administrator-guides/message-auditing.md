# Message Auditing Panel

The Message Auditing Panel includes the following features, allowing you or specified users to:

* Review messages between users in the Message Auditing Panel.
* Check details in the Auditing Log about the individuals who used the Message Auditing Panel.

You access the Message Auditing Panel and the Message Auditing Log from the Administration UI ![](../.gitbook/assets/administrator-ui.png).

This feature is only available with the Enterprise and Gold versions of Rocket.Chat.

### Review Search Results

The Message Auditing Panel returns all messages that match the search values defined in the mandatory fields for each option.

Note that the auditor does not have to be a participant in the room to be able to read the messages. However, the auditor cannot read the encrypted messages of other users if they are not included in the conversation. In this case, Rocket.Chat recommends that you disable message encryption:

* Go to the Administration UI ![](../.gitbook/assets/administrator-ui.png).
* Click **Administration**.
* Scroll down to **E2E Encryption** on the left-side menu.

## Review the Message Auditing Log

To check the details about who used the Message Auditing Panel and their search results, you must have the `auditor-log` role or the `can-audit-log` permission.

## Check Historical Edits and Deletions

Rocket.Chat recommends the following setting preferences to enable you to view any modified or removed messages.

* Got to the Administration UI ![](../.gitbook/assets/administrator-ui.png).
* Click **Administration**.
* Scroll down to **Messages** on the left-side menu.

Make sure to set your message preferences as follows:

* Enable **Allow Message Editing** and **Keep Per Message Editing History** to see a history of all messages and not only the last edit made.
* Disable **Allow Message Deleting**, otherwise messages show only the _message deleted_ status and you cannot see the complete message history.
