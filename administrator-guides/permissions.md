# Permissions

Rocket.Chat has a vast and customizable permissions system. Most of the actions a user can make requires a certain permission so you can customize what users can do and see.

You can find the permission grid under Administration -&gt; Permissions.

Permission changes are immediate and transparent. Users do not need to logout, login or refresh to change permissions.

## Roles

A `Role` is a set of permissions that can be given to users. Rocket.Chat already comes with a set of default roles that can be edited. You can also create new roles for users.

When someone is registered in a Rocket.Chat server, it will normally receive the `user`. If the user is a bot or a guest from a livechat channel, it can receive different roles. Also the first user of a server always receives the role of `admin`.

Roles can have different scopes. Currently we have two scopes `Users` and `Subscriptions`. The permissions of the `Users` roles are valid for the whole server, while the `Subscriptions` roles only apply to individual channels, where a user have to be elected to that role in that channel.

An example of `Users` role would be an `admin`, that have permissions valid for the whole server, while a `moderator` that have a `Subscriptions` role would have permissions only in a channel that they were elected for that role.

Also, by default roles are shown as little tags on the side of a username on messages.

### Default Roles

* **admin** `(Users)` - Have access to all settings and administrator tools.
* **moderator** `(Subscriptions)` - Have moderation permissions for a channel. Has to be elected by a channel owner.
* **owner** `(Subscriptions)` - Have owner permissions for a channel. When a user creates a channel they become the owner of that channel. They can also elect more owners for that channel.
* **user** `(Users)` - Normal user rights. Most users receive this role when registering.
* **bot** `(Users)` - Special Role for bot users, with some permissions related to bot functionality.
* **leader** `(Subscriptions)` - it doesn't have any special permissions, but is used when setting a `leader` to a channel. Leaders appear on the header of a channel.
* **anonymous** `(Users)` - unauthenticated users that access the server when the `Allow Anonymous Read` setting is activated.
* **guest** `(Users)` - anonymous users that want to write and participate in channels when the `Allow Anonymous Read` and `Allow Anonymous Write` settings are activated.
* **livechat-agent** `(Users)` - Agents of livechat. They can answer to livechat requests.
* **livechat-manager** `(Users)` - Manager of livechat, they can manage agents and guest.
* **livechat-guest** `(Users)` - Users coming from a livechat channel.
