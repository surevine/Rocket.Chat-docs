# Advanced White-Labeling

In these guides we will cover how to customize styling in more depth and how to add custom Javascript scripts to your server.

Please use caution when using these settings, as the misuse of them can cause problems on your server

## Custom CSS

Can be found in Administration =&gt; Layout. This allows you to overwrite styling on ui. For the full maestry of this setting we recommend studying the source code, as seen that overwriting classes directly can lead to side effects on styling.

### CSS Variables

Rocket.Chat uses css variables to store key values when styling. Rocket.Chat recommends only overwriting the css variables, as you will have more control on what will be changed.

You can find the full list of variables here

## Custom Scripts

You can add custom scripts for when a user takes specific actions. Scripts must be written in Javascript.

### Logout Flow

This script runs after the user has logged out.

### Custom Script for Logged Out Users

Custom Script that will run whenever a user that is not logged in access your server url. e.g. \(whenever you enter the login page\)

### Custom Script for Logged In Users

Custom Script that will run whenever a user that is logged in access your server url \(eg. opens a browser page or the desktop app\)
