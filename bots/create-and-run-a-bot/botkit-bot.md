# Run a Botkit Bot

Botkit is the leading developer tool for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms.

Botkit offers everything you need to design, build and operate an app:

* Easy-to-extend starter kits;
* Fully-featured SDK with support for all major platforms;
* [Tons of plugins and middlewares](https://botkit.ai/docs/readme-middlewares.html)

In addition, Botkit works with all the NLP services \(like Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson\), it can use any type of database, and runs on almost any hosting platform.

## Quick start guide

Botkit is a Node.js module and works with Node and npm.

The fastest way to start with Botkit is using [botkit-starter-rocketchat](https://github.com/RocketChat/botkit-starter-rocketchat):

**1. clone the starter repo and install dependencies**

```text
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/botkit-starter-rocketchat
cd botkit-starter-rocketchat/
npm install
```

**2. create a `.env` file with the following content**

```text
ROCKETCHAT_URL=<ROCKETCHAT HOST>
ROCKETCHAT_USER=<BOTKIT USER NAME>
ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=<BOTKIT USER PASS>
ROCKETCHAT_USE_SSL=<SSL USAGE>
ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=<ROCKETCHAT CHANNEL>
MENTION_ROOMS=<CHANNEL THAT THE BOT WILL ONLY ANSWER WHEN MENTIONED>
RESPOND_TO_DM=<ENABLE BOT TO RESPOND TO DIRECT MESSAGES>
RESPOND_TO_LIVECHAT=<ENABLE BOT TO RESPOND TO LIVE CHAT>
RESPOND_TO_EDITED=<ENABLE BOT TO RESPOND TO EDITED MESSAGES>
```

**3. run the bot**

```text
npm start
```

After executing the command, botkit will try to connect to the Rocket.Chat instance and then will listen to messages in `general` room:

**4. talk to your bot**

On the server, login as a regular user \(not the BOT user\), go to `general` room, and try to talk to your bot:
