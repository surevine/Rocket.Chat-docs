# Run a Botpress Bot

Botpress is an on-prem, open-source chatbot building platform for businesses.

## Quick start guide

Botpress is a Node.js package and works with Node and npm.

The fastest way to start with Botpress is using [botpress-kick-starter](https://github.com/RocketChat/botpress-kick-starter) repository that is already integrated with Rocket.Chat via [botpress-channel connector](https://github.com/RocketChat/botpress-channel-rocketchat).

Navigate to the folder where you want to work with the bot and proceed with the following steps:

**1. install botpress package**

```text
npm init -y
npm install botpress@10.40.0
```

**1. create a bot**

```text
mkdir bot
cd bot
../node_modules/.bin/botpress init
```

`botpress init` command launches a wizard that will help you create the initial configuration. You should see something as follows:

```text
$ ../node_modules/.bin/botpress init

Next steps:
1) Install bot dependencies by running npm install (or yarn install)
2) Start the bot by running npm start (or yarn start)

Enjoy Botpress!
```

**1. install botpress connector and bot dependencies**

```text
npm install
npm install botpress-channel-rocketchat
```

**2. configure the bot**

Open `config` folder and create `channel-rocketchat.json` file with the following content:

```text
{
    "ROCKETCHAT_USER": <BOTPRESS USER NAME>,
    "ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD": <BOTPRESS USER PASS>,
    "ROCKETCHAT_URL": <ROCKETCHAT HOST>,
    "ROCKETCHAT_USE_SSL": <SSL USAGE>,
    "ROCKETCHAT_ROOM": <ROCKETCHAT CHANNEL>,
    "scope": ""
}
```

Adjust the content to fit your server and user credentials. Make sure `mybotuser` has a `BOT` role on the server. For more information on how to create a bot user please refer to [this page](./#1-create-a-bot-user).

**3. run the bot**

```text
npm start
```

After executing the command, botpress will try to do the following actions:

* launch botpress instance;
* launch dedicated Admin Dashboard;
* launch dedicated Webchat window;
* connect to the Rocket.Chat instance;
* listen to messages in `general` room.

```text
$ npm start
