# Run a Hubot bot

## Quick start guide

The fastest way to start with Hubot bot is to use [Hubot boilerplate](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate). The boilerplate is a simple Node.js package that requires Hubot and the Rocket.Chat adapter. The bot can then be executed using a [bin file](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate/tree/master/bin) in production, or via the package scripts locally using `npm run local` or `yarn local`.

Navigate to the folder where you want to work with the bot and proceed with the following steps:

**1. clone the boilerplate repo and install dependencies**

```text
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate
cd hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate
npm install
```

**2. create a `.env` file with the following content**

```text
export ROCKETCHAT_URL=myserver.com
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=mybotuser
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=mypassword
export ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=general
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=true
```

Adjust the content to fit your server and user credentials. Make sure `mybotuser` has a `BOT` role on the server. For more information on how to create a bot user please refer to [this page](./#1-create-a-bot-user).

**3. run the bot**

```text
source .env
bin/hubot
```

After executing the last command, hubot will try to connect to the Rocket.Chat instance and then will listen to messages in `general` room:

### Run a Hubot bot on production

With the example above, you can run the bot in production using the following command:

```text
bin/hubot -a rocketchat
```

This command will install dependencies and run the bot with Rocket.Chat's Hubot adapter.

## Advanced instructions

### Configuration

When running locally, [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is used to load configurations from the `./.env` file. That makes it easier to set environment variables.

Please a full list of environmental variables [here](../configure-bot-environment.md).

Please pay attention that if `ROCKETCHAT_URL` is using `https://`, you **MUST** setup websocket pass-through on your reverse proxy \(for example, NGINX\) with a valid certificate \(not self-signed\). Directly accessing Rocket.Chat without a reverse proxy via `https://` is not possible.

### Running in production

There are executables for different environments that all run the Hubot binary:

* `bin/hubot` - for Linux/Unix
* `bin/hubot.cmd` - for Windows
* `Procfile` - for Heroku

Before running, make sure your production environment has the required environment variables for the adapter, url, user, name and pass. As an alternative, you can add them as command-line parameters, like `-a rocketchat`.

Environmental variables should be populated on the server before the launch \(see [configuration](hubot-bot.md#configuration)\). The launcher will also install npm dependencies on every run, in case it is booting in a fresh container \(this isn't required when working locally\).

See more information on deployment configurations [here](https://hubot.github.com/docs/deploying/).

### Adding scripts

Scripts can be added to the `./scripts` folder, or by installing node packages and listing their names in the `external-scripts.json` array. There is an example of each in this repo but neither is required.

### Checking example scripts

The boilerplate comes pre-packed with two scripts as demos for manual tests. In each of the following script, you can talk to a bot in a public channel by prefixing the bot's username or in direct messages without the bot's username.

* `what time is it` or `what's the time` - Tells you the current time
* `rc version` - Gives you version info about Rocket.Chat and Hubot \(two messages\)

### Deployment using Docker

**1. clone the hubot repo and go into the clonned directory**

```text
git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git
cd hubot-rocketchat
```

**2. start the Docker container**

```text
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
    -e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
    -e RESPOND_TO_DM=true \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_USER=mybotuser \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=mybotpassword \
    -e HUBOT_NAME=bot \
    -e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostics \
    rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

On the container launch, hubot will try to connect to the Rocket.Chat instance and then will listen to messages in all public rooms:

```text

[Sun Sep 29 2019 16:49:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)] INFO Setting up reactive message list...
```

**3. talk to your bot**

On the server, login as a regular user \(not the BOT user\), go to `general` or any other room, and try the following command:

```text
mybotuser time
```

You can also talk to the bot using its alias:

```text
rocketbot time
```

Both commands result in the same output:

![docker-hubot-time](../../.gitbook/assets/docker-hubot-time.png).

#### Important notes

* The first time you run the docker container, the image needs to be pulled from the public docker registry, which takes some time. Subsequent runs are super fast.
* If you are not running Linux \(i.e. if you are on a Mac or PC\), you cannot use $PWD to mount the volumes. Instead, [read the _If you are using Boot2Docker..._ note](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) to determine the absolute path where you must place the git-cloned directory.

#### Adding scripts

To include your own scripts, you can use the following Docker command:

```text
docker run -it -e ROCKETCHAT_URL=your rocketchat instance>:<port> \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_ROOM='' \
    -e LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true \
    -e RESPOND_TO_DM=true \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_USER=mybotuser \
    -e ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=mybotpassword \
    -e HUBOT_NAME=bot \
    -e EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-diagnostics \
    -v $PWD/scripts:/home/hubot/scripts \
    rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat
```

### Deployment using Yeoman

[Yeoman generator](https://github.com/hubotio/generator-hubot) allows you to generate a Hubot bot using the Rocket.Chat adapter. Yeoman uses the latest versions of Hubot and Rocket.Chat adapter module, which enable asynchronous processing in ES6 Javascript, and introduce various bug fixes.

### Development for different versions of adapter

#### v2.x.x

**Standard**

In a Hubot instance once `hubot-rocketchat` is added by npm or yarn, you can replace the package with a development version directly:

* `cd node_modules` from the bot's project root
* `rm -rf hubot-rocketchat` to delete the published version
* `git clone git@github.com:RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat.git` to add dev version
* `cd hubot-rocketchat` move to dev path
* `npm install` install dependencies

**Linked**

Setting up a locally linked package is easier for continued development and/or using the same development version of the adapter in multiple bots.

* Change directory to your development adapter path
* `npm link` or `yarn link` to set the origin of the link
* Change directory to your bot's project root
* `npm link hubot-rocketchat` or `yarn link hubot-rocketchat` to create the link

#### v1.x.x and v0.x.x

**Docker-compose**

If you want to use docker-compose for this task, add this for v0.1.4 adapter \(this must be inserted in your docker-compose.yml\):

```text
# hubot, the popular chatbot (add the bot user first and change the password before starting this image)
hubot:
image: rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat:v0.1.4
environment:
    - ROCKETCHAT_URL=your-rocket-chat-instance-ip:3000 (e.g. 192.168.2.240:3000)
    - ROCKETCHAT_ROOM=general
    - RESPOND_TO_DM=true
    - ROCKETCHAT_USER=username-of-your-bot
    - ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=yourpass
    - BOT_NAME=bot
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY=yourgoogleapikey
# you can add more scripts as you'd like here, they need to be installable by npm
    - EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS=hubot-help,hubot-seen,hubot-links,hubot-diagnostics,hubot-google,hubot-reddit,hubot-bofh,hubot-bookmark,hubot-shipit,hubot-maps
links:
    - rocketchat:rocketchat
# this is used to expose the hubot port for notifications on the host on port 3001, e.g. for hubot-jenkins-notifier
ports:
    - 3001:8080
```

If you want your bot to listen to all public rooms and all private rooms it is joined to, leave the env `ROCKETCHAT_ROOM` empty like in the example above and set the env `LISTEN_ON_ALL_PUBLIC=true`.

Please pay attention to some external scripts that are in the example above, as some of them need your Google-API-Key in the docker compose file.

## Version information and compatibility

The examples above use [Hubot](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot) v3 and [Rocketchat.Chat adapter](https://github.com/rocketchat/hubot-rocketchat) v2, using the new \[Rocket.Chat JS SDK\]\[[sdk](https://github.com/rocketchat/Rocket.Chat.js.SDK) for Rocket.Chat instances 0.60.0 onward.

v2 contains major breaking changes. Starting with this version:

* CoffeeScript BOTs will no longer be supported, all new bot scripts should be written in NodeJS 8 compatible JavaScript
* Only [Hubot v3](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot/tree/v3) will be supported
* [Rocket.Chat Server version 0.63.0](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/0.63.0) or higher is supported
* Yeoman generator support is discontinued, you should start your project with our [hubot v3 boilerplate](https://github.com/RocketChat/hubot-rocketchat-boilerplate)
* [NodeJS 8](https://nodejs.org/) or later is required for operations
* The latest ES6 syntax in NodeJS 8, including the popular async-await, is fully supported

### Hubot versions

Versions of `hubot-rocketchat` prior to v2 are incompatible with Hubot v3

This bot is written in ES6 and intended to run on Node v8+. To run a bot on older versions of Node would require compilation with Babel to use the full ES6 feature set.

### Adapter versions

Older versions of the adapter \(before v0.1.4\) are incompatible with more recent versions of Rocket.Chat \(v0.35+\). Please report an issue, if you find specific version mismatch.

NOTE: releases between 0.35.0 and 0.37.1 are not recommended for hubot operations.

Rocket.Chat adapter v1 uses CoffeeScript, which makes extention of classes in JavaScript ES6 troublesome.

v1 versions of the adapter are only compatible with 0.37.1 and higher of Rocket.Chat Server. However, you should be able to continue using v1 adapter and CoffeeScript bots with the most up-to-date version of the server.

If you are writing CoffeeScript bots, you need Hubot v2.x and v1.x.x or v0.x.x of the adapter. Please see [instructions for v1.x.x and v0.x.x of the adapter](hubot-bot.md#v1xx-and-v0xx).

## Additional information

For more examples on building and scripting your bot, please see [Hubot documentation](https://hubot.github.com/docs/).

## FAQ

Q: I am not trying to stage a denial of service attack, why would I ever want to write a bot? A: There are many positive and productive use cases for bots. Imagine a customer service support chat. As soon as a customer enters the support channel, a bot immediately identifies the customer and then:

* fetches recent sales information from the sales dept server
* fetches personal information from the customer data base
* fetches latest notes made by her/his salesperson from the CRM system
* scans the customer's facebook and twitter posts
* obtains details of the last support ticket for this customer

Putting it altogether and then private message the service rep with the information.

Another use-case is a load test bot, imagine a bot that accepts the command:

```text
rocketbot loadtest europe 25, asia 50, usa 100, canada 10
```

This command specifies a distribution of test bot instances, to be created across globally located data centers.

Once received, the bot:

* parses the distribution
* concurrently ssh to remote Kubernetes controllers and spawns the specified number of test bot instances to start the load test

Q: The architecture of hubot-rocketchat looks interesting, can you tell me more about it? A: Sure, it is based on hubot-meteorchat. hubot-meteorchat is the hubot integration project for Meteor based chats and real-time messaging systems. Its driver based architecture simplifies creation and customization of adapter for new systems. For example, the hubot-rocketchat integration is just hubot-meteorchat + Rocket.Chat driver.
