# Developing Rocket.Chat Apps

## What is a Rocket.Chat App?

A Rocket.Chat App is an integration or a plugin which is created in an isolated environment. You can also create your own App and publish it on our official [Marketplace](https://rocket.chat/marketplace) to share with the world. Users can download your application from the marketplace and use it.

Below are a few guides which will help you get started with Rocket.Chat App CLI to create and publish your own applications.
