# Logging into a server

To login to a server [register](registration.md) an account manually or with a pre-configured OAuth service.

## Manual Log in

To manually log in, you must have used the [manual registration method](registration.md) or have set a `password` in your account settings.

You can log in using either your `username` or `email` and `password`.

## OAuth Log in

Your server's system administrator enables OAuth login. If an OAuth service is enabled, click the icon for that service \(i.e., GitHub or Google\), and then follow the on-screen prompts to log in.
