## Security

Enable or disable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account on a Rocket.Chat server.

When you enable 2FA, you are required to get a key code from an app on your phone, thus increasing security when logging in.

**Note**:  2FA can be turned on and off by the system admin, if you can't find this setting, please contact your system admin.

To enable 2FA, you need to:

- Click the **Enable two-factor authentication** button.

- Use an authentication app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo, to scan the QR code. Scanning the QR code displays a six-digit code. Enter the code into Rocket.Chat.

- Copy your backup code somewhere safe if you need to access it in the future without the authentication app. Click **Send** to finish.

- To disable the 2FA, click on **Stop two-factor authentication**.
